A product manager aligns the needs of users, the business strategy, and the work of the development team. Their goal is to discover high-value problems using data and research, test and validate possible solutions (like through experiments and prototypes), and deliver product outcomes that improve user experience while also supporting key business goals, such as growth and revenue.
